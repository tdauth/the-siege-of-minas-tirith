## Description

Two forces fight each other over the city Minas Tirith.
Gondor must protect the White Tree at any cost until the Army of the Dead arrives.
Mordor has to destroy the White Tree before the Army of the Dead arrives and kills them all.


Every player can choose one hero from a number of characters from the Lord of the Ring movies.
Each hero can only be chosen once.
When the hero dies he/she is revived automatically.
You can repick your hero and he/she will keep the XP and items.


Every player has to train units and control the shared player which is either Gondor or Mordor.
Gondor can build defense structures to protect the city like Trebuchets.

The gates of the city can be opened/closed by Gondor players.
Mordor has to push into the city by destroying the gates to reach the White Tree.

Killing hostile units and heroes gives the players gold.
There is no automatic income.
Gold is only used for buying items and upgrading units.
